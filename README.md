## Installation

To use this package, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer.

```bash
npm install react-parcel-config
```

## Getting Started

To create a new React project using this package, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the package as shown in the [Installation](#installation) section.

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

3. Create a new `index.html` file and `index.js` file (or any other entry point for your application) in the chosen directory.

4. Add the necessary content to the `index.html` and `index.js` files. You can start with a simple React component in the `index.js` file.

5. Open your terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the same directory as the `index.html` and `index.js` files, and then run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server using Parcel, and you should be able to view your React application in the browser at the specified port (typically http://localhost:1234 or another port if 1234 is already in use).

## Features

- Sets up a basic React project with Parcel bundler.
- Includes support for React and React DOM.
- Instantly start building React applications without complex configurations.

## Usage

This package provides a basic template for React projects with Parcel. The template includes a simple `index.html` file and `index.js` file to get you started. You can customize and expand upon this template as needed for your React application.

The project structure will look like this:

```
my-react-app/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â””â”€â”€ index.js
  â””â”€â”€ package.json
  â””â”€â”€ package-lock.json
```

You can edit the `index.html` file to include additional styles, scripts, or other dependencies. Likewise, modify the `index.js` file to define your React components and build your application.

Feel free to add other dependencies, configurations, and features to suit your project requirements. You can also update the npm package in the future to include additional templates or boilerplate code.

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for running tasks in the project:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server using Parcel, enabling live development and hot module replacement (HMR).
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of your application.
